* DNA 
Stole this little image as it relates back to some of the previous ones nicely in style!

** Deoxyribonucleic Acid
- The information that programs all of our cells activities
- A 6 billion letter, long code that provides the instruction set for LIFE! 

** Bio-molecules 
- On going from what we said in [[03-Bio-molecules.org][Bio-Molecules]] DNA is the last of the four essential biological molecules
 - Carbohydrates 
 - Lipids 
 - Proteins
 - Nucleic Acids  

*** Nucleic Acids 
- (Objectively) Have the most complex job of all the bio-molecules 
- Structurally they are polymers
  - Meaning that they are made up of many small repeating molecular units 
- These polymers are made up of nucleotides
  - Nucleotides linked together form polynucleotides

**** Nucleotides
What makes up a nucleotide? 
- A 5 carbon sugar molecule
- A phosphate group 
- 1 of the 4 nitrogen bases
  - Adenine
  - Thymine
  - Cytosine
  - Guanine

*** Double Helix 
- In living organisms DNA doesn't exist as a single polynucleotide string 
- It exists in a pair of molecules which are held tightly together. 
- In what is basically a ladder (but twisted!)
- The supports holding these two strands together are the sugars and phosphate groups
  - As backbones, rather than forming across the pairs 
- These supports run down both sides of the molecule but in different directions 
  - Looking at these backbones, one appears to be in reverse order
    - One starts with the sugar being connected to the 5^{th} carbon of the sugar module
    - And ends where the next phosphate will go with the 'free' end at the next sugars 3^{rd} carbon 
    - This creates the phrase "5 Prime & 3 Prime" used to indicate direction 
    - The other strand is the opposite in going 3 -> 5
- These nitrogen bases are held together by relatively weak hydrogen bonds
- They cannot be just "any pair"
  - They are A->T and G->C
  - A->T has 2 hydrogen bonds
  - G-> has 3 making it slightly stronger
- It is this "Base Sequence" which dictates what the DNA codes for!

*** Fun DNA Facts! 
- In Humans, chromosome 1 (the largest of all of them) has a single DNA molecule containing 247 Million base pairs
- Printing all of the letters of this chromosome 1 into a book would be about 200 thousand pages long
- Each somatic cell (again in humans) has 46 DNA molecules packed into it!
