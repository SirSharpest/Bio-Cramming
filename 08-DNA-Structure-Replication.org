* DNA 
Stole this little image as it relates back to some of the previous ones nicely in style!

** Deoxyribonucleic Acid
- The information that programs all of our cells activities
- A 6 billion letter, long code that provides the instruction set for LIFE! 

** Bio-molecules 
- On going from what we said in [[03-Bio-molecules.org][Bio-Molecules]] DNA is the last of the four essential biological molecules
 - Carbohydrates 
 - Lipids 
 - Proteins
 - Nucleic Acids  

*** Nucleic Acids 
- (Objectively) Have the most complex job of all the bio-molecules 
- Structurally they are polymers
  - Meaning that they are made up of many small repeating molecular units 
- These polymers are made up of nucleotides
  - Nucleotides linked together form polynucleotides

**** Nucleotides
What makes up a nucleotide? 
- A 5 carbon sugar molecule
- A phosphate group 
- 1 of the 4 nitrogen bases
