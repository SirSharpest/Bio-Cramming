* Biological Molecules

They are the: 

- Instructions 
- Energy Storage 
- Essential Sources of Energy 

And they come in: 

- Carbohydrates 
- Lipids 
- Proteins
- Nucleic Acids 

All organisms need to synthesise or ingest these to live!  


** Carbohydrates

- They are the source of all energy that we have available to us 
- Made up of sugars

#+CAPTION: Glucose Molecule
#+NAME: fig:1

*** The most simple of which are the Monosaccharides 
- Glucose is the star of the show (#1) because it comes from the sun (plants etc...) 
- Fructose, same as glucose but arranged differently 
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose][Glucose info wiki]]

*** There are also disaccharides (obvious in name) 
- Sucrose (covelent bond of Fructose and Glucose) 

*** Polysaccharides Longer and longer chains of sugars
- Instead of being bursts/nibblets of energy they become store houses of energy 
- They become really good for building with because of this. 
- Starch and cellulose being very common

**** Cellulose 
- This is bunch of glucose molecules bound together
- Most common organic compound on the planet. 
- Hard to digest, which is why cows can, we can't
- Very good for storing energy too... (bread, starch)
- [[http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/starlose.htm][starch/cellulose info]] 
- Fun fact, every-time a glucose chain gets longer off pops a h_{2}0 


***** Plants Energy store
- Plants store glucose in the form of starch 
- CONFUSED BETWEEN THIS AND CELLULOSE? ME TOO
  - Clarification [[http://pslc.ws/macrog/kidsmac/starlose.htm][Starch vs Cellulose]]

***** Animals (humans) Energy store
- We store our carbohydrates energy in Glycogen? 
  - Which is very similar to starch but a lot more complex. 

**** Strength or Energy 

***** Starch (Energy) 
- Plants really know how to use glucose, to make starch they use \alpha-glucose (with the -OH pointed down) 
- Starch is really good at storing energy
- It forms a curve shape because of joining the OH pointing downwards. 
- The starch polymer forms a kind of package 
- Many starch polymers have a lot of branches that are short chains of glucose 
- When plants need energy they grab some starch and start chomping glucose off the ends!

***** Cellulose (Strength) 
- Cellulose is used to make plants' leaves and stems (or trunks) stable and strong. 
- To make cellulose plants use \beta-glucose with the OH pointed out. 
- Plants flip every other glucose over too. (WEIRD, BUT WORKS) 
- Flipping allows for cellulose chains to stretch out and cram next into each other.
- Think strong fibrous things like rope

** Lipids (triglycerides mostly in plants) 
- Info for plant lipids [[http://www.cyberlipid.org/glycer/glyc0005.htm][here]]
- In seeds the storage of triglycerides is often high
- triglycerides are converted back to carbohydrates during germination 
- lipids are smaller and simpler than complex carbohydrates
- They are insoluble in water because of their chemical bonds being non-polar (see [[file:02-Water.org][water notes]])
- To get triglycerides you take glycerol and fatty acid chains
- Triglycerides come in either saturated or unsaturated 
- Saturated in hydrogen that is... 
- Because of carbon (see [[file:01-Chem.org][carbon notes]]) is very nimble in the amount of bonds it makes.
 If the carbon atoms in a fatty acid are connected with single bonds, 
 all the carbon atoms end up connected to at least 2 hydrogen atoms and one with picking up a third.
 A saturated fatty acids is formed 
- When some of the carbon atoms are done in double bonds to each other, all of the carbons electrons are spoken for
 and so some of the hydrogen atoms cannot be picked up, these are unsaturated fatty acids 
- Transfats - ignore these as they do not occur in nature and are evil

*** Phospholipid 
- Take triglyceride and swap one of it's fatty acids for a phosphate group and you have a phospholipid 
- These make up cell membrane walls
- On all cells! 
- This gives the molecule a polar end and a non-polar end 
- Scattering phospholipids in water would end-up arranging themselves into a fuzzy looking corridor with the 
 hydophilic ends being the walls and the hydrophobic tails being the internals

*** Steroids 
- Another form of lipid
- Formed of a backbone of 4 interconnected rings of carbon 
- Hundreds of variation 
- Most common of which is the cholesterol 
  - Which binds with phospholipids to help form cell walls 
- Can be activated to turn into lipid hormones
