* Heredity

** Aristotle
Okay quick note on why I always rant about needing to know everything; Aristotle laid down some information 
about how traits were passed on, and no one really questioned them for a good few hundred years. How many other things
are like this? That we have used 'logic' and made assumptions without providing proper truths. Okay, rant over for now.

For example Aristotle believed that should a white squirrel and a black squirrel were to mate, their offspring would 
be grey. 

** Gregor Mendel

This is the man who questioned how genes really worked! 

- He recognised that traits follow certain patterns 
- Working with pea plants 
- Made lots of experiments crossing these plants 
  - This let him see which traits got passed on 
- Came up with a frame work to see how traits actually got passed on 

** Classical Genetics 
As much as I'd rather use plant examples it's currently easier to use humans... 

*** Humans have 23 [pairs] of Chromosomes 
- This is the form that DNA takes when getting passed on from parent to child
- The pairing is important to note as this makes humans diploid
  - Some plants are Polyploid! 
  - This is actually super interesting, more on that later

*** Genes 
- A gene (singular) is a specific section on a chromosome that contains information which determines a trait

**** Question: How do you know when a gene stats and stops?
- So basically Genes have a secret code which marks the beginning and ending of their sequence. 
- DNA is read in triplets
- These are called 'Codons'
- This is a very messy descent into genetics about what they look like and what they mean in RNA/DNA
  - Hopefully more in later notes
 

**** Polygenic Trait
- Of course the majority of the time a physical trait is a reflection of a bunch of different genes working together
 this is known as a polygenic trait 

**** Pleiotropic 
- Sometimes a single gene can end up affecting how a whole bunch of stuff will be expressed. 
- When this is the case it is known as being a pielotropic gene.

**** Mendelian Trait 
- Named after Mendel 
- Refers to a single gene affecting a single trait 
- The colour of pea flowers for example, which Mendel studied. 
- The consistency of ear wax in humans is one as another example 

** Ear wax gene example 
[[./images/earwax.png]]

- As there is just one gene which determines earwax consistency and that one gene is located in the same place 
 in every person's chromosome set 
- It is located in set 16 
- However there is one version of this gene (or *Allele*) which says it will be wet and another which says to be dry
- A glycine in the ammino acid chain wll result in wet earwax
[[./images/glycineear.png]] 
- A Arginine will produce dry

*** How do you get what you get? 
- In most things, anything which isn't a sperm or an egg cell is known as *somatic* cells. 
- In sex cells or *gametes* are haploid cells. Meaning they only have 1 set of chromosomes? 
  - Note in the Damien Rice song "The Professor" he mentions "Gametes Disease", this may be a reference to him suffering from being male.
- For the earwax allele consider your parents, mother having a wet allele, and father dry.
  (Remembering that each parent also has potentially wet and dry alleles given by their parents)
  - The one passed to you is entirely random
- Mendel also discovered that whilst you can have both traits, one can be *Dominant* and the other *Recessive*
- Dominance being where one allele masks or completely suppresses the expression of the other. 

**** Allele Dominance 
- Lets say that your mother gives you a dominant allele for wet and father's dry is recessive
- These are symbolised with big *W* and little *w* for dominant and recessive respectfully
|-----+-----|
| Wet | Dry |
|-----+-----|
| *W* | *w* |
|-----+-----| 
- Everyone inherits two alleles from their parents
- Inheriting two different alleles is called the *Heterozygous* [genotype] 
  - Which means inheriting two different types of the same gene. 
- *Homozygous* is the opposite where you inherit the same type from both parents

**** Punnet Squares 
- These let us diagram the outcome of a particular cross breeding experiment
- Can be used to show potential phenotypes (that is to say the physical expression of the genes) 
- Still running with the ear wax 
  - Assume mother has *W,w* and father *w,w* where *W* is dominant and *w* recessive

|-----+---------+---------|
| *W* | *W* *w* | *W* *w* |
| *w* | *w* *w* | *w* *w* |
|-----+---------+---------|

- From this we can see that any child from this mating has a 50/50 chance of being either Heterozygous or Homozygous
