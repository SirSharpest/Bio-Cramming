* Heredity

** Aristotle
Okay quick note on why I always rant about needing to know everything; Aristotle laid down some information 
about how traits were passed on, and no one really questioned them for a good few hundred years. How many other things
are like this? That we have used 'logic' and made assumptions without providing proper truths. Okay, rant over for now.

For example Aristotle believed that should a white squirrel and a black squirrel were to mate, their offspring would 
be grey. 

** Gregor Mendel 
[[./images/mendel.png]]

This is the man who questioned how genes really worked! 

- He recognised that traits follow certain patterns 
- Working with pea plants 
- Made lots of experiments crossing these plants 
  - This let him see which traits got passed on 
- Came up with a frame work to see how traits actually got passed on 

** Classical Genetics 
As much as I'd rather use plant examples it's currently easier to use humans... 

*** Humans have 23 [pairs] of Chromosomes 
- This is the form that DNA takes when getting passed on from parent to child
- The pairing is important to note as this makes humans diploid
  - Some plants are Polyploid! 
  - This is actually super interesting, more on that later

*** Genes 
- A gene (singular) is a specific section on a chromosome that contains information which determines a trait 

[[./images/genes.png]]

**** Question: How do you know when a gene stats and stops?
- So basically Genes have a secret code which marks the beginning and ending of their sequence. 
- DNA is read in triplets
- These are called 'Codons'
- This is a very messy descent into genetics about what they look like and what they mean in RNA/DNA
  - Hopefully more in later notes
 

**** Polygenic Trait
- Of course the majority of the time a physical trait is a reflection of a bunch of different genes working together
 this is known as a polygenic trait 

**** Pleiotropic 
- Sometimes a single gene can end up affecting how a whole bunch of stuff will be expressed. 
- When this is the case it is known as being a pielotropic gene.

**** Mendelian Trait 
- Named after Mendel 
- Refers to a single gene affecting a single trait 
- The colour of pea flowers for example, which Mendel studied. 
- The consistency of ear wax in humans is one as another example 

** Ear wax gene example 
[[./images/earwax.png]]

- As there is just one gene which determines earwax consistency and that one gene is located in the same place 
 in every person's chromosome set 
- It is located in set 16 
- However there is one version of this gene (or *Allele*) which says it will be wet and another which says to be dry
- A glycine in the ammino acid chain wll result in wet earwax
[[./images/glycineear.png]] 
- A Arginine will produce dry

*** How do you get what you get? 
- In most things, anything which isn't a sperm or an egg cell is known as *somatic* cells. 
- In sex cells or *gametes* are haploid cells. Meaning they only have 1 set of chromosomes? 
  - Note in the Damien Rice song "The Professor" he mentions "Gametes Disease", this may be a reference to him suffering from being male.
- For the earwax allele consider your parents, mother having a wet allele, and father dry.
  (Remembering that each parent also has potentially wet and dry alleles given by their parents)
  - The one passed to you is entirely random
- Mendel also discovered that whilst you can have both traits, one can be *Dominant* and the other *Recessive*
- Dominance being where one allele masks or completely suppresses the expression of the other. 

**** Allele Dominance 
- Lets say that your mother gives you a dominant allele for wet and father's dry is recessive
- These are symbolised with big *W* and little *w* for dominant and recessive respectfully
|-----+-----|
| Wet | Dry |
|-----+-----|
| *W* | *w* |
|-----+-----| 
- Everyone inherits two alleles from their parents
- Inheriting two different alleles is called the *Heterozygous* [genotype] 
  - Which means inheriting two different types of the same gene. 
- *Homozygous* is the opposite where you inherit the same type from both parents

**** Punnet Squares 
- These let us diagram the outcome of a particular cross breeding experiment
- Can be used to show potential phenotypes (that is to say the physical expression of the genes) 
- Still running with the ear wax 
  - Assume mother has *W,w* and father *w,w* where *W* is dominant and *w* recessive
#+attr_latex: :environment longtable :align |l|c|c| 
|-----+---------+---------|
|     | *w*     | *w*     |
|-----+---------+---------|
| *W* | *W* *w* | *W* *w* |
| *w* | *w* *w* | *w* *w* |
|-----+---------+---------|

- From this we can see that any child from this mating has a 50/50 chance of being either Heterozygous or Homozygous
- Important to remember that dominance is only so, if present, so whilst \[1/4\] of the alleles are *W* 
 there is still only 4 possibilities, 2 of which have the dominant gene.  

*** Earwax gene is an example of Pleiotropic 
- The gene which codes for earwax also affects body-odour because they are produced by the same type of gland. 
- This makes it a great example of a Pleiotropic gene, as it has an effect on multiple phenotypes. 

** Sex-based inheritance 
- As we have 23 chromosomes 
- 22 pairs of autosomes 
  - Non-sex chromosomes 
- 23^{rd} pair are sex-chromosomes 
- At this position women have 2 full length chromosomes (*XX*)
- Whilst men have 1 full *X* and one short *Y* chromosome. 
- This explains gender specific traits. 
- Also explains some traits only possible for offspring to have gotten from a single parent 
- Without a complimentary chromosome to provide argument information, it leads to some things always being expressed
  - For instance, balding in men, is given through the mother's line.

* Clarifications

** Genotype/Phenotype 
- A Genotype is the internal 'nature' of a thing, as Mendel described it
- The Phenotype is the physical manifestation of a trait
- Thus the two cannot be used to assume each other. 

** When we talk about Genes, what are they really?
 A gene is just a set of instructions for making a protein. 
It's the protein that does all the work, giving us traits like red hair, blue eyes, or freckles.

** Are all sperm and egg cells the same?
I found a good answer of this on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1nklqa/does_it_really_matter_which_sperm_cell_reached/][reddit]] here's the response

"Every cell in the human body is diploid, in that it carries 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). All, except for the gametes, which are sex cells. Usually, cells replicate/reproduce themselves through mitosis, whereby they replicate the DNA, then spilt into two. But to produce gametes, like sperm cells and ova, it's a little different.
They are produced through meiosis. The simplified version, is that a sex cell replicates itself into two, each with 46 chromosomes, then those split into a total of four, with 23 each. During this process, bits of DNA 'cross over' between homologous chromosomes, which adds to genetic variability. Furthermore, independent assortment of the chromosomes occurs, such that in your sperm cells, may be a mixture of your dad's chromosomes, and your mum's, independently assorted from one another.
This process allows for a lot of variability, 2^{23} different possibilities, plus the process of crossing over, and random genetic mutations (rare-ish).
So yes, it matters a lot which sperm gets to the egg."

** What causes Dominance in Alleles
[[http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask227][Good question and answer found here]]

- Just because an allele is recessive, does not mean that it is less common in all genetic material than the 
 dominant. 

** Dominant isn't always common! 
- [[https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2011/06/06/dominant-isn%25E2%2580%2599t-always-common/][Good read here about why dominant isn't always so when it comes to populations]]

** Allele types 
- Some alleles can blend
  - Think flower colour sometimes 
- Some can both be present and show up 
  - Think spotted animals like rabbits or dogs 
- And some are backups and used if something goes wrong

** What decides the allele passed on to offspring? 
- [[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/inheritance-of-traits-by-offspring-follows-predictable-6524925][Here would suggest that it is predictable]] 

** Why is DNA packaged into Chromosome?
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5mfzz6/why_does_dna_pack_itself_into_chromosomes_for/][This question was asked here and maybe of some use / insight on this]]
