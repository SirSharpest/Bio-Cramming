* Water 
- Only element to appear naturally in all 3 forms

** Why is water so important 
- H_{2}O (Covalent bond) 
- Polarity 

*** Cohesion
- All h2o is attracted to other h2o molecules. 
- Weak bond
- Cohesion 
- Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metalic liquid (beads up) 
- Allows bugs and lizards and jesus to walk on water 
- Adhesion on the other hand i.e. between water and glass causes a wider surface area 
- Capillary Action (causes water to join with other water against gravity 

*** Solvent
- Water is the worlds best solvent 
- There are more substances that dissolve in water than in anything else 
- Hydrophilic - polar - their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of the water 
- Hydrophobic - non-polar - is pushed out of water by the cohesive forces of water  

*** Ice Density 
- Everything else is more dense as a solid, NOT WATER 
- Life is possible because of ice floating 
- At 0 C, water molecules start to solidify and the hydrogen atoms form crystal structures to space things out.

*** Heat Capacity
- Water is really good at holding onto heat
- Makes the oceans giant heatsinks!
