* Photosynthesis 

** Kinds of Reactions in Photosynthesis
- Light dependant 
- Light independent
  - Calvin Cycle

** What does Photosynthesis need? 

*** Water (assuming we have a vascular plant) 
- Plants that use roots to move water to the leaves 
- Using tissues called Xylem
*** Carbon Dioxide 
- Gets in through pores in the leaves called stomata (oxygen gets out here too)
- Side note, it is surprisingly important that plants keep oxygen levels low within their cells. 
*** Sunlight 
- Individual photons from the sun are absorbed by a pigment called Chlorophyll    
  - Stored in Chloroplasts which are not just big sacks of *Cholophyll*, there's a complex internal structure
  - Cholophyll is stashed *Thylakoids* (Phospholipid bilayers) 
  - Which are stacked into *Grana* 
  - With *Lumen* inside
  - and outside this but inside the Chloroplasts is the *Stroma*

** Stage 1

1. A photon from the sun makes a 93 million mile journey, arriving on a piece of chlorophyll
2. An electron absorbs the energy from the photon (I didn't understand this either [[https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-does-an-electron-absorb-energy-from-a-photon.371949/][detailed response to the question]])
3. The electron becomes "excited" that is to say it has energy and no where to put it (Photoexcitation) 
4. The goal of the the plant becomes turning this electron into something "useful" 

This first chlorophyll is not on its own. It is part of an insanely complex array of proteins, lipids and
other molecules that are part of a system called "Photosystem II". 
- This process contains at least 99 different chemicals 
- and over 30 individual chlorophyll molecules 
- It is the first of 4 Protein Complexes that plants need for the light dependant reactions
- Yes the first stage is called 2...
- The full name is: Plastoquinone Oxidoreductase 
- Or PSII
