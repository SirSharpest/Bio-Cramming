* Organic Compounds 

- Class of compounds that contain carbon
- Carbon is small, as an atom, 6 protons, 6 neutrons, 6 electrons,  with a total weight of 12
- Carbon can take on cool shapes because of its smallness. 
- Can do things that bulkier atoms could not 
- The gymnast of atoms 
- Carbon is 'kind' 
- Carbon wants more electrons but is easy about it.
- Needs 4 more electrons and doesn't really care where they come from
- Will happy to bond with loads of things at once 
- Will join in an infinite number of configurations. 
- Is so fundamental, that it is difficult to imagine a form of life not being based on it. 

** Covalent bonds 

- Carbon forms covalent bonds 
- It will happily share it's electrons 
- A good example of this is Methane 
- 4 Hydrogen will form with 1 carbon to produce a methane compound
- Lewis dot structure.
- Polar covalent bonds 

** Ionic Bonds 

- Do NOT share electrons 
- donate or accept electrons 
- Live as a charged atom or ion 
- Salt will happily destroy everything else to get sodium and chlorine together. 
- Like getting two crazy friends together. 

** Hydrogen bonds 

- Polar covalent bonds stick together hydrogen end to oxygen end
- One example of seeing this is water bubbling together at the top of a glass
- Don't just happen in water 
- Happens in proteins a lot
- Weak and Strong bondings varies wildly
- Making and breaking bonds is the key to life itself (and death)
