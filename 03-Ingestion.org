* Biological Molecules

They are the: 

- Instructions 
- Energy Storage 
- Essential Sources of Energy 

And they come in: 

- Carbohydrates 
- Lipids 
- Proteins
- Nucleic Acids 

All organisms need to synthesise or ingest these to live!  


** Carbohydrates

- They are the source of all energy that we have available to us 
- Made up of sugars 

*** The most simple of which are the Monosaccharides 
- Glucose is the star of the show (#1) because it comes from the sun (plants etc...) 
- Fructose, same as glucose but arranged differently 
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose][Glucose info wiki]]

*** There are also disaccharides (obvious in name) 
- Sucrose (covelent bond of Fructose and Glucose 

*** Polysaccharides Longer and longer chains of sugars
- Instead of being bursts/nibblets of energy they become store houses of energy 
- They become really good for building with because of this. 

**** Cellulose 
- This is bunch of glucose molecules bound together
- Most common organic compound on the planet. 
- Hard to digest, which is why cows can, we can't
- Very good for storing energy too... (bread, starch) 

***** Plants Energy store
- Plants store glucose in the form of starch 
- CONFUSED BETWEEN THIS AND CELLULOSE? ME TOO
  - Clarification [[http://pslc.ws/macrog/kidsmac/starlose.htm][Starch vs Cellulose]]

***** Animals (humans) Energy store
- We store our carbohydrates energy in Glycogen? 
  - Which is very similar to starch but a lot more complex.
