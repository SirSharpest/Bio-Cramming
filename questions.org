* TODO Why do plants store their energy in fruits/vegetables/tubors 
- Oh I think it's for the next generation.
- We steal their energy... 

* TODO Cell walls, does each cell have multiple walls? 
- If so, what is between them
- Do they each stop a unique thing each? 

* TODO Cell walls, if they stop things passing through, how do transport proteins get access to larger molecules?
* TODO If for example humans are bad at breaking down cellulose and cell walls are mostly made from it, then even fruit has a lot of it? Why can we break this down?
* TODO What is/was the benefit of evolving prokaryotes to eukaryotes
- [[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/_0/endosymbiosis_03][More reading]]
* TODO Cell detoxification in smooth er, does this work the same in plants
- i.e. in humans it helps with stuff derived from drugs / alcohol, does it work same in plants 
* TODO Genes, how do they really start and stop? (Hidden stops?) 
* TODO Genes, humans diploid so in sex cells 1 from each parent, in say hexiploid is it 3 per parent?
