* Robert Hooke
- In 1665 Robert Hooke first observed cells, and it is agreed that since then, we have taken things too far. 
- They were named cells because they appeared to be barren and empty with not much going on inside... like a 
 monks bedroom (or so I'm told)

* We only care about plants (for now) so a quick bit of animal cell info
- Animal cells lack of cell walls, allow them to move easier 
- Plants can't dance (well some people say they can, but that's a different matter)
- A flexible membrane is why animal cells have had such success at creating lots of different structures and 
 organ types, tissue types that would not be possible with a ridged forms 
- The ability to move oneself around is \texttrademark{} by kingdom Animalia
** What about Protozoan
- No 
- They don't have have specialised muscle tissue
- They have creepy weird things like flagella 

* Plant Cells 

** Cell walls 
- See [[file:04-Cell-Membranes.org][Cell Membrane notes for more]]
- The cell walls that protect plants and give them structure also limit them from developing complex 
 nerve structures and muscle cells that allow animals to move forcibly.
