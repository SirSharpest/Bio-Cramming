* Robert Hooke
- In 1665 Robert Hooke first observed cells, and it is agreed that since then, we have taken things too far. 
- They were named cells because they appeared to be barren and empty with not much going on inside... like a 
 monks bedroom (or so I'm told) 
- Important note... this was wrong, so much going on inside!

* Handy Analogy
A cell is like a city: 
- Defined geographical limits 
- A ruling government
- Power plants
- Waste / recycling treatment plants
- A police force  
- Industry sectors 
- No hippy government where people talk and vote on crap
  - Think North Korea. 

* Eukaryotic Meaning
- Named for having a 'good kernel', that is to say the nucleus 
- Prokaryotic meaning 'before the kernel' 

* We only care about plants (for now) so a quick bit of animal cell info
[[./images/animalcell.png]]
- Animal cells lack of cell walls, allow them to move easier 
- Plants can't dance (well some people say they can, but that's a different matter)
- A flexible membrane is why animal cells have had such success at creating lots of different structures and 
 organ types, tissue types that would not be possible with a ridged forms 
- The ability to move oneself around is \texttrademark{} by kingdom Animalia
** What about Protozoan
- No 
- They don't have have specialised muscle tissue
- They have creepy weird things like flagella 

* Handy Comparison chart
[[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Animal_Cell_vs_Plant_Cell][Plant Cell v Animal Cell]]

** Interesting to pull from that table is that
- most plant cells don't have Cilia
- Some cells have Flagella 

Both Flagellum and Cilia are made of protein fibres called Microtubules.

** History 
- Plants probably evolved >500 million years ago
- Earliest plant fossils found are Lycophytes 
  - Which still exist today
  - Work by shedding a bunch of spores and hoping for the best.
  - Evolved into scale trees (now extinct) 
    - Graveyards of these becoming large veins of coal  
  - Carboniferous Peroid being the epoch of geological history because of the scale tree forests
- Plants which use flowers to reproduce (Angiosperms) didn't show up until the end of the cretaceous period.
 65 million years ago (just as the dinosaurs were packing up)
  - To do: find out if dinosaurs were allergic to flowers 

** Cell walls 
- See [[file:04-Cell-Membranes.org][Cell Membrane notes for more]]
- The cell walls that protect plants and give them structure also limit them from developing complex 
 nerve structures and muscle cells that allow animals to move forcibly. 

** Organelles 
- Essentially factories which do stuff! 
- Loads of them 
- Suspended in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm][Cytoplasm]] (give wiki link as first mention of it in these notes and is important) 
- [[https://www.quora.com/Is-nucleolus-an-organelle][Is the Nucleolus an Organelle?]] 
  - This question is interesting as it shows my thoughts on Biology well as being a grey subject at times. 
  - Some answers say Yes, some No. 
  - It seems like yes, but with a few rule breaking characteristics... is it the platypus of the Eukaryotic world?

*** Cytoplasm 
- A solution of water and nutrients  
- Inside of which is the cytoskeleton 
  - A bunch of protein cells which reinforce the cell
  - Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement
    - They assemble long microtubles that act like steal girders which holds things together
- Cytoplasm provides the infastructure required for all of the organelles to do what they need to do.
- EXCEPTION of the nucleus which has its own internal structure called the nucleoplasm (think city of London vs
 London, or Kim Jung's house in NK)
