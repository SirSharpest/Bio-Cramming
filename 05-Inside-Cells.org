* Robert Hooke
- In 1665 Robert Hooke first observed cells, and it is agreed that since then, we have taken things too far. 
- They were named cells because they appeared to be barren and empty with not much going on inside... like a 
 monks bedroom (or so I'm told) 
- Important note... this was wrong, so much going on inside!

* Handy Analogy
A cell is like a city: 
- Defined geographical limits 
- A ruling government
- Power plants
- Waste / recycling treatment plants
- A police force  
- Industry sectors 
- No hippy government where people talk and vote on crap
  - Think North Korea. 

* Eukaryotic Meaning
- Named for having a 'good kernel', that is to say the nucleus 
- Prokaryotic meaning 'before the kernel' 

* We only care about plants (for now) so a quick bit of animal cell info
[[./images/animalcell.png]]
- Animal cells lack of cell walls, allow them to move easier 
- Plants can't dance (well some people say they can, but that's a different matter)
- A flexible membrane is why animal cells have had such success at creating lots of different structures and 
 organ types, tissue types that would not be possible with a ridged forms 
- The ability to move oneself around is \texttrademark{} by kingdom Animalia
** What about Protozoan
- No 
- They don't have have specialised muscle tissue
- They have creepy weird things like flagella 

* Handy Comparison chart
[[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Animal_Cell_vs_Plant_Cell][Plant Cell v Animal Cell]]

** Interesting to pull from that table is that
- most plant cells don't have Cilia
- Some cells have Flagella 

Both Flagellum and Cilia are made of protein fibres called Microtubules.

* Plant Cells

** History 
- Plants probably evolved >500 million years ago
- Earliest plant fossils found are Lycophytes 
  - Which still exist today
  - Work by shedding a bunch of spores and hoping for the best.
  - Evolved into scale trees (now extinct) 
    - Graveyards of these becoming large veins of coal  
  - Carboniferous Peroid being the epoch of geological history because of the scale tree forests
- Plants which use flowers to reproduce (Angiosperms) didn't show up until the end of the cretaceous period.
 65 million years ago (just as the dinosaurs were packing up)
  - To do: find out if dinosaurs were allergic to flowers 

** Cell walls 
- See [[file:04-Cell-Membranes.org][Cell Membrane notes for more]]
- The cell walls that protect plants and give them structure also limit them from developing complex 
 nerve structures and muscle cells that allow animals to move forcibly. 

** Organelles 
- Essentially factories which do stuff! 
- Loads of them 
- Suspended in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm][Cytoplasm]] (give wiki link as first mention of it in these notes and is important) 
- [[https://www.quora.com/Is-nucleolus-an-organelle][Is the Nucleolus an Organelle?]] 
  - This question is interesting as it shows my thoughts on Biology well as being a grey subject at times. 
  - Some answers say Yes, some No. 
  - It seems like yes, but with a few rule breaking characteristics... is it the platypus of the Eukaryotic world?

*** Cytoplasm 
- A solution of water and nutrients  
- Inside of which is the cytoskeleton 
  - A bunch of protein cells which reinforce the cell
  - Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement
    - They assemble long microtubles that act like steal girders which holds things together
- Cytoplasm provides the infastructure required for all of the organelles to do what they need to do.
- EXCEPTION of the nucleus which has its own internal structure called the nucleoplasm (think city of London vs
 London, or Kim Jung's house in NK) 

*** Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) 
- Is an organelle which acts a manufacturing and packaging system
- Works as a network of membranes to synthesise proteins. 
- Made of phospolipid Bilayers 
- Both Rough and Smooth have the same types of membranes, but different shapes. 
- The double membranes of both types of ER form sacs called cisternae
- [[http://www.biology4kids.com/files/cell_er.html][More info on ER]]

**** Rough ER 
- Looks bumpy because it has ribosomes attached 
- More detail will be found on Ribosomes when they're looked at in more detail
- Very important in the synthesis and packaging of proteins. 
- The RER is attached to the nuclear envelope surrounding the Nucleus. 
- The close proximity of RER to the nucleus allows for molecules to move between both membranes.

*****  Protein synthesis 
- begins when mRNA (again more later) moves from the nucleus to a ribosome on the surface of the RER
- As the ribosome builds the amino acid chain, the chain is pushed into the cisternal space of the RER
- When proteins are complete they collect and the RER pinches off a vesicle
- That vesicle, a small membrane bubble, can move to the cell membrane or the golgi apparatus (more later)
- Some of the proteins will be used in the cell and some will be sent out.

**** Smooth ER 
- Doesn't have ribosomes attached 
- Smooth network of tubes 
- Acts as a factory - warehouse 
- Contains Enzymes which help with the creation of important Lipids
- [[file:03-Bio-molecules.org][Phospolipid notes]]
- Some enzymes specialise in cell detoxification 
  - Done by adding a carboxal group to them, to make them soluble in water
- Stores ions in solutions that may be needed later on
- Cells which release oils have more SER than most cells
***** Sarcoplasmic Reticulum 
- Is a variation of the SER
- It is able to store many ions in solution
- When a cell needs to do something immediately, it uses this rather than scavenge around the environment


** Reference terms
 
| amyloplast                   | an organelle in some plant cells that stores starch. Amyloplasts are found in starchy plants like tubers and fruits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ATP                          | ATP is short for adenosine triphosphate; it is a high-energy molecule used for energy storage by organisms. In plant cells, ATP is produced in the cristae of mitochondria and chloroplasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| cell membrane                | the thin layer of protein and fat that surrounds the cell, but is inside the cell wall. The cell membrane is semipermeable, allowing some substances to pass into the cell and blocking others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| cell wall                    | a thick, rigid membrane that surrounds a plant cell. This layer of cellulose fiber gives the cell most of its support and structure. The cell wall also bonds with other cell walls to form the structure of the plant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| centrosome                   | (also called the "microtubule organizing center") a small body located near the nucleus - it has a dense center and radiating tubules. The centrosomes is where microtubules are made. During cell division (mitosis), the centrosome divides and the two parts move to opposite sides of the dividing cell. Unlike the centrosomes in animal cells, plant cell centrosomes do not have centrioles.                                                                                   |
| chlorophyll                  | chlorophyll is a molecule that can use light energy from sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide gas into sugar and oxygen (this process is called photosynthesis). Chlorophyll is magnesium based and is usually green.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| chloroplast                  | an elongated or disc-shaped organelle containing chlorophyll. Photosynthesis (in which energy from sunlight is converted into chemical energy - food) takes place in the chloroplasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| christae                     | (singular crista) the multiply-folded inner membrane of a cell's mitochondrion that are finger-like projections. The walls of the cristae are the site of the cell's energy production (it is where ATP is generated).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| cytoplasm                    | the jellylike material outside the cell nucleus in which the organelles are located.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Golgi body                   | (also called the golgi apparatus or golgi complex) a flattened, layered, sac-like organelle that looks like a stack of pancakes and is located near the nucleus. The golgi body packages proteins and carbohydrates into membrane-bound vesicles for "export" from the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| granum                       | (plural grana) A stack of thylakoid disks within the chloroplast is called a granum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| mitochondrion                | spherical to rod-shaped organelles with a double membrane. The inner membrane is infolded many times, forming a series of projections (called cristae).

The nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear membrane                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| photosynthesis               | a process in which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food energy (sugars and starches), oxygen and water. Chlorophyll or closely-related pigments (substances that color the plant) are essential to the photosynthetic process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| rough endoplasmic reticulum  | (rough ER) a vast system of interconnected, membranous, infolded and convoluted sacks that are located in the cell's cytoplasm (the ER is continuous with the outer nuclear membrane). Rough ER is covered with ribosomes that give it a rough appearance. Rough ER transport materials through the cell and produces proteins in sacks called cisternae (which are sent to the Golgi body, or inserted into the cell membrane).                                                      |
| smooth endoplasmic reticulum | (smooth ER) a vast system of interconnected, membranous, infolded and convoluted tubes that are located in the cell's cytoplasm (the ER is continuous with the outer nuclear membrane). The space within the ER is called the ER lumen. Smooth ER transport materials through the cell. It contains enzymes and produces and digests lipids (fats) and membrane proteins; smooth ER buds off from rough ER, moving the newly-made proteins and lipids to the Golgi body and membranes |
| stroma                       | part of the chloroplasts in plant cells, located within the inner membrane of chloroplasts, between the grana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| thylakoid disk               | thylakoid disks are disk-shaped membrane structures in chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are made up of stacks of thylakoid disks; a stack of thylakoid disks is called a granum. Photosynthesis (the production of ATP molecules from sunlight) takes place on thylakoid disks.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| vacuole                      | a large, membrane-bound space within a plant cell that is filled with fluid. Most plant cells have a single vacuole that takes up much of the cell. It helps maintain the shape of the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
