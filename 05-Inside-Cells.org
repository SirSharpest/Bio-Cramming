* Robert Hooke
- In 1665 Robert Hooke first observed cells, and it is agreed that since then, we have taken things too far. 
- They were named cells because they appeared to be barren and empty with not much going on inside... like a 
 monks bedroom (or so I'm told) 
- Important note... this was wrong, so much going on inside!

* Handy Analogy
A cell is like a city: 
- Defined geographical limits 
- A ruling government
- Power plants
- Waste / recycling treatment plants
- A police force  
- Industry sectors 
- No hippy government where people talk and vote on crap
  - Think North Korea. 

* Eukaryotic Meaning
- Named for having a 'good kernel', that is to say the nucleus 
- Prokaryotic meaning 'before the kernel' 

* We only care about plants (for now) so a quick bit of animal cell info
[[./images/animalcell.png]]
- Animal cells lack of cell walls, allow them to move easier 
- Plants can't dance (well some people say they can, but that's a different matter)
- A flexible membrane is why animal cells have had such success at creating lots of different structures and 
 organ types, tissue types that would not be possible with a ridged forms 
- The ability to move oneself around is \texttrademark{} by kingdom Animalia
** What about Protozoan
- No 
- They don't have have specialised muscle tissue
- They have creepy weird things like flagella 

* Handy Comparison chart
[[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Animal_Cell_vs_Plant_Cell][Plant Cell v Animal Cell]]

** Interesting to pull from that table is that
- most plant cells don't have Cilia
- Some cells have Flagella 

Both Flagellum and Cilia are made of protein fibres called Microtubules.

* Inside Plant Cells 
[[./images/plantcell.png]] 

** History 
- Plants probably evolved >500 million years ago
- Earliest plant fossils found are Lycophytes 
  - Which still exist today
  - Work by shedding a bunch of spores and hoping for the best.
  - Evolved into scale trees (now extinct) 
    - Graveyards of these becoming large veins of coal  
  - Carboniferous Peroid being the epoch of geological history because of the scale tree forests
- Plants which use flowers to reproduce (Angiosperms) didn't show up until the end of the cretaceous period.
 65 million years ago (just as the dinosaurs were packing up)
  - To do: find out if dinosaurs were allergic to flowers 

** Cell walls 
- See [[file:04-Cell-Membranes.org][Cell Membrane notes for more]]
- The cell walls that protect plants and give them structure also limit them from developing complex 
 nerve structures and muscle cells that allow animals to move forcibly. 

** Organelles 
- Essentially factories which do stuff! 
- Loads of them 
- Suspended in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm][Cytoplasm]] (give wiki link as first mention of it in these notes and is important) 
- [[https://www.quora.com/Is-nucleolus-an-organelle][Is the Nucleolus an Organelle?]] 
  - This question is interesting as it shows my thoughts on Biology well as being a grey subject at times. 
  - Some answers say Yes, some No. 
  - It seems like yes, but with a few rule breaking characteristics... is it the platypus of the Eukaryotic world?

*** Cytoplasm 
- A solution of water and nutrients  
- Inside of which is the cytoskeleton 
  - A bunch of protein cells which reinforce the cell
  - Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement
    - They assemble long microtubles that act like steal girders which holds things together
- Cytoplasm provides the infastructure required for all of the organelles to do what they need to do.
- EXCEPTION of the nucleus which has its own internal structure called the nucleoplasm (think city of London vs
 London, or Kim Jung's house in NK) 

*** Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) 
- Is an organelle which acts a manufacturing and packaging system
- Works as a network of membranes to synthesise proteins. 
- Made of phospolipid Bilayers 
- Both Rough and Smooth have the same types of membranes, but different shapes. 
- The double membranes of both types of ER form sacs called cisternae
- [[http://www.biology4kids.com/files/cell_er.html][More info on ER]]

**** Rough ER 
- Looks bumpy because it has ribosomes attached 
- More detail will be found on Ribosomes when they're looked at in more detail
- Very important in the synthesis and packaging of proteins. 
- The RER is attached to the nuclear envelope surrounding the Nucleus. 
- The close proximity of RER to the nucleus allows for molecules to move between both membranes.


*****  Protein synthesis 
- begins when mRNA (again more later) moves from the nucleus to a ribosome on the surface of the RER
- As the ribosome builds the amino acid chain, the chain is pushed into the cisternal space of the RER
- When proteins are complete they collect and the RER pinches off a vesicle
- That vesicle, a small membrane bubble, can move to the cell membrane or the golgi apparatus (more later)
- Some of the proteins will be used in the cell and some will be sent out.

**** Smooth ER 
- Doesn't have ribosomes attached 
- Smooth network of tubes 
- Acts as a factory - warehouse 
- Contains Enzymes which help with the creation of important Lipids
- [[file:03-Bio-molecules.org][Phospolipid notes]]
- Some enzymes specialise in cell detoxification 
  - Done by adding a carboxal group to them, to make them soluble in water
- Stores ions in solutions that may be needed later on
- Cells which release oils have more SER than most cells
***** Sarcoplasmic Reticulum 
- Is a variation of the SER
- It is able to store many ions in solution
- When a cell needs to do something immediately, it uses this rather than scavenge around the environment

*** Ribosomes 
N.B. Very very basic explanation that is no where near enough to appreciate the entire process!

- These can float freely throughout cytoplasm 
- Or be attached to the nuclear envelope which is where they are spat out from
- Their role is to assemble ammino acids into polypeptides 
- When the chain is built, it is pushed into the ER 
- When complete the ER sends it off to the Golgi Apparatus 
**** Are Ribosomes Organelles?
- Short answer no, [[https://www.life.illinois.edu/mcb/150/private/faq/index.php?action%3Dartikel&cat%3D2&id%3D1172&artlang%3Den][and here is why]]

[[./images/ribo.png]]

*** Golgi Apparatus 
- Apparatus makes it sound like a very high-tech piece of machinery
  - Which it is... 
  - It's made up of stacks of membranous layers (sometimes called Golgi bodies) 
    - Golgi bodies cut up large proteins into smaller hormones 
    - Can combine proteins and carbohydrates to make other molecules 
- In the City analogy this is the post office 
- Here proteins are processed and packaged and sent out to where they need to go. 
- Out puts from the golgi apparatus are transported in Vesicles 
- Golgi Bodies also put the finishing touches on Lysosomes 
[[./images/golgi.png]] 

*** Vesicles 
- These transport molecules manufactured by the golgi apparatus
- Have a phospholipid membrane
- Can move internal to the cell or externally 
- Bit more info can be found in previous notes on [[file:04-Cell-Membranes.org][Cell Membrnaes]] in the transport section

*** Lysosomes 
- These are basically the waste treatment part of the cell 
- Handle cell digestion 
- Basically sacks full of enzymes which break down cellular waste and debris
- Converts this waste into new building materials by breaking them down into simple structures 
- Releases what it breaks down into the cytoplasm to be reused. 
  
*** Mitochondria 
Had a quick look to see if these acted the same in animals as they do in plants and there is a 
[[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/1536370][journal on the subject]] the abstract seems to be enough to assume that for the most part yes. 

- Where respiration takes place 
- The place where energy is derived from carbohydrates, fats and other fuels
- Converts things into ATP (Adenosine triphosphate)
- Pretty cool in that they have their own DNA 
  - This means that because these replicate themselves in a separate fashion, 
 at reproduction this cells DNA is not mixed between parents.

**** ATP
More detailed info later in respiration and ATP 

- For now this is the major currency used when it comes to energy within cells. 

*** Plastids 
- Something that animals 100% don't have (I swear if someone tells me they do, I'm done with biology) 
- They make and store their needed compounds 
- These and mitochondria started as bacteria that were absorbed into plant cells early in their evolution 
  - Scientists know this apparently because of their double membrane
- The most important of the plastids is the chloroplasts

[[./images/plasts.png]]

**** Chloroplasts
- As with a lot of things there is more detailed notes on this in the photosynthesis sections 
- These convert light energy from the sun (how do plants in the UK work then?) and convert them to sugar 
 and oxygen. 
  - Fortunately the plant doesn't need the extra oxygen so at some point expels it. 
- All the green parts of a plant, are all filled with cells which are filled with chloroplasts 

*** Central Cacuole 
- Plant cells can push water into vacuoles 
  - These provide turgor pressure
- Reinforces the plants already rigid structure 
- When cells lose some water turgor pressure drops 
  - Thin celery stalks going limp over time 
- This is also a kind of storage container for the cell 
  - For water (ICE)
  - Other compounds the cell might need also contained here
- Can be used to export things the cell doesn't need anymore like wastes

** Nucleus
- The beloved leader 
- Super highly specialised 
- Lives away in its own double membraned, high security compound 
  - With its buddy the nucleolus 
- In charge in a major way, as it stores the cell's DNA
  - All of the information required for the cell to do its job
- Makes all of the laws for the cell 
  - Tells all the organelles how to grow, what to metabolise, what to do, what to synthesis, when and how to divide
- All of what it does, comes from the blueprints encoded in its DNA. 
  - To build proteins that will facilitate a specific job getting done. 
  - Fret not! There will more information on protein synthesis.
- The Necleus holds its precious DNA (along with some proteins) in a web-like substance called Chromatain

*** Chromatain 
- When it comes time for the cell to split the chromatain gathers into rod shaped chromosomes 
 each of which holds DNA molecules 
  - [[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2006-01/1137011862.Cb.r.html][Do all cells split at some point?]] Is about humans but applicable 

*** Nucleolus
- This is not enveloped by its own membrane
- Is just a gooey splotch of stuff within the nucleus 
- Main job is creating rRNA (ribosomal RNA) 
  - Which it then combines with the proteins needed for the basic units of ribosomes
  - Once these are done they are spat out through the nuclear envelope, where they are fully assembled 
- The nucleolus then sends messages in the form of mRNA to those ribosomes (which are kinda like henchmen who carry
 out orders in the rest of the cell. 
- How ribosomes do all of this is again, super complex and will be done in more depth in protein synthesis notes.
