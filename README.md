# Bio-Cramming
This is a personal repo of my bio notes I'm building up
It would be nice if anyone ever stumbles across this and finds it interesting, do let me know. 

Biology is so huge, it's like the universe expanding before me, the more that I learn. So obviously a lot
of this may be wrong, or lack depth. If so I can only aplogise. 


Feel free to share, to steal my notes or to write me hate mail all to: nathan1hughes@gmail.com
