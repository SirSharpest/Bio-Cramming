* Please note
- Whilst this is named ATP it is actually more focused on the photosynthesis process 
- Because I only really care about plants... 

* Photosynthesis 

** Kinds of Reactions in Photosynthesis
- Light dependant 
- Light independent
  - Calvin Cycle

** What does Photosynthesis need? 

*** Water (assuming we have a vascular plant) 
- Plants that use roots to move water to the leaves 
- Using tissues called Xylem
*** Carbon Dioxide 
- Gets in through pores in the leaves called stomata (oxygen gets out here too)
- Side note, it is surprisingly important that plants keep oxygen levels low within their cells. 
*** Sunlight 
- Individual photons from the sun are absorbed by a pigment called Chlorophyll    
  - Stored in Chloroplasts which are not just big sacks of *Cholophyll*, there's a complex internal structure
  - Cholophyll is stashed *Thylakoids* (Phospholipid bilayers) 
  - Which are stacked into *Grana* 
  - With *Lumen* inside
  - and outside this but inside the Chloroplasts is the *Stroma*
