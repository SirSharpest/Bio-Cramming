* Cell Membranes

** Getting DNA from Banana example 
- First step is to add shampoo to the banana 
- Remembering that in eukaryotic cells DNA is within a nuclear membrane which is within the main cell membrane itself.
- And also remember as it's a plant cell it is within a cell wall 
- Adding soap will dissolve the nuclear membrane and release the DNA (The cell wall can be destroyed with a blender)  
- Soap destroys the cell wall because it is made up of lipids 

** Selective Permeability 
- Cells only allow certain things in and certain things out. 
- It uses the Cell membrane for this 
- Our understanding of the membrane is based on the fluid mosaic model. 

*** Important within the cell membrane are: 
- Cholesterol 
- Glycoprotiens 
- Glycolipids 

and slightly more important are: 

**** Phospholipids
- Amphipathic (part repels, part attracted to water)
- Allow small and uncharged particles to move through it 

**** Proteins 
- Mostly regulate transport 
- Allow large and charged things to get through
