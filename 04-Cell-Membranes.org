* Cell Membranes

** Getting DNA from Banana example 
- First step is to add shampoo to the banana 
- Remembering that in eukaryotic cells DNA is within a nuclear membrane which is within the main cell membrane itself.
- And also remember as it's a plant cell it is within a cell wall 
- Adding soap will dissolve the nuclear membrane and release the DNA (The cell wall can be destroyed with a blender)  
- Soap destroys the cell wall because it is made up of lipids 

** Selective Permeability 
- Cells only allow certain things in and certain things out. 
- It uses the Cell membrane for this 
- Our understanding of the membrane is based on the fluid mosaic model. 

*** Important within the cell membrane are: 
- Cholesterol 
- Glycoprotiens 
- Glycolipids 

and slightly more important are: 

**** Phospholipids
- Amphipathic (part repels, part attracted to water)
- Allow small and uncharged particles to move through it 
- Made of carbon and hydrogen (Hydro-carbon) 
- Attracts water without letting it pass through 
- Easy for Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen to pass through (both super small and both no charge)
  - Diffusion! 

**** Proteins 
- Mostly regulate transport 
- Allow large and charged things to get through 
- Facilitated diffusion
- Aquaporin allows for H_{2}O to pass through the cell membrane
- Can also do active transport (see Na^{+} and K^{+} pump) 

*** Types of proteins that allow larger molecules passage

** Parts of the membrane 
- Crazy how complex it really is
- Made up of a number of different things 
- Is know as being 'fluid' all of the things are moving within it 
- If things weren't fluid, nothing could get through 

*** Cholesterol 
- Connects phospholipids together 
- Slows them so they don't drift apart too quickly 
- e.g. when a temperature changes, our membranes would fall apart without this. 
- Keeps them from getting too close too (if cold) 

*** Glycoprotein 
- Most commonly known one - Anti-bodies (plants don't have these per se)

  - [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0981942800001650][They do have glycoproteins, I checked]]

*** Glycolipids 
- Fats with sugars attached on the outside
- Used for signalling 
- Decides parts of a molecule to take in. Works as a key in a lock mechanism

** Plants Cell Wall!
- Because I had to ask I think it's worth noting that plants have both the cell wall for structure
 and the cell membrane  
- [[https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid%3D20080323134925AAoY214][How do things get through a cell wall?]]
  - Cell walls are permeable to small molecules 
  - This is still a limiting factor of the size of which can get into the plasma membrane 
  - Cell wall is made of cellulose which is porous 
  - Key nutrients, especially water and carbon dioxide are distributed throughout the plant 
 from cell wall to cell wall
- Cell wall allows water to be held in.

*** Bacteria have a cell wall too! 
- Is what antibiotics attack (usually)
- Made of different chemicals though 
*** Fungi also have them
- Also made of different chemicals
