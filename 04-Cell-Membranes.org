* Cell Membranes

** Getting DNA from Banana example 
- First step is to add shampoo to the banana 
- Remembering that in eukaryotic cells DNA is within a nuclear membrane which is within the main cell membrane itself.
- And also remember as it's a plant cell it is within a cell wall 
- Adding soap will dissolve the nuclear membrane and release the DNA (The cell wall can be destroyed with a blender)  
- Soap destroys the cell wall because it is made up of lipids 

** Selective Permeability 
- Cells only allow certain things in and certain things out. 
- It uses the Cell membrane for this 
- Our understanding of the membrane is based on the fluid mosaic model. 

*** Important within the cell membrane are: 
- Cholesterol 
- Glycoprotiens 
- Glycolipids 

and slightly more important are: 

**** Phospholipids
- Amphipathic (part repels, part attracted to water)
- Allow small and uncharged particles to move through it 

**** Proteins 
- Mostly regulate transport 
- Allow large and charged things to get through 

** Parts of the membrane 
- Crazy how complex it really is
- Made up of a number of different things 
- Is know as being 'fluid' all of the things are moving within it

** Plants are the only glorious beings to have a cell wall for structure!
- Because I had to ask I think it's worth noting that plants have both the cell wall for structure
 and the cell membrane

  - Cell walls are permeable to small molecules 
  - This is still a limiting factor of the size of which can get into the plasma membrane 
  - Cell wall is made of cellulose which is porous 
  - Key nutrients, especially water and carbon dioxide are distributed throughout the plant 
 from cell wall to cell wall
